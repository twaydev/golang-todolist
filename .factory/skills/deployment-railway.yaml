  [build]
  builder = "dockerfile"
  dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"
  
  [deploy]
  startCommand = "/app/bot"
  healthcheckPath = "/health"
  healthcheckTimeout = 30
  restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
  restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

deployment_process: |
  # Install Railway CLI
  npm install -g @railway/cli
  
  # Login
  railway login
  
  # Link project
  railway link
  
  # Add environment variables
  railway variables set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=xxx
  railway variables set DATABASE_URL=xxx
  railway variables set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=xxx

        - name: Install Railway CLI
          run: npm install -g @railway/cli
        
        - name: Deploy
          run: railway up --service telegram-todo-bot
          env:
            RAILWAY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}

best_practices:
  - Use railway.toml for configuration
  - Set health check endpoint
  - Use environment variables for secrets
  - Enable auto-deploys from main branch
  - Set up staging environment
  - Monitor logs and metrics
